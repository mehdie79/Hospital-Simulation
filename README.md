# Hospital Emergency Department Simulation

This project is a hospital emergency department simulation system implemented in C++. The simulation aims to replicate the dynamic operations within an emergency department, including patient flow, medical treatments, and resource management. The simulation utilizes an event-driven approach, where events and their associated routines coordinate the different aspects of the simulation.

## Features

- Event-driven simulation of a hospital's emergency department
- Real-time representation of patient flow, medical treatments, and resource management
- Efficient data structures and event routines to synchronize the simulation

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-emergency-simulation.git
```

2. Build the project using:

```
make proj1
```

## Usage

Run the simulation executable:
